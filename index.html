<p>I am currently pursuing a career in real estate while studying Business: AS in Entrepreneurial Studies. 
    My goal is to earn my realtor license in California and later in Las Vegas, where I plan to move soon. 
    I hope to expand my career by becoming a broker in the future. In my free time, I enjoy listening to music, playing games like NBA 2K, Call of Duty, and GTA V, and learning new skills that can benefit my future. 
    One of my long-term goals is to start a podcast to share my life experiences and how Iâ€™ve overcome challenges.

        One of my favorite websites is 
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, 
        because I can use it to learn anything visually as I am a visual learner.
