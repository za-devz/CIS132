        <h2>My College Experience</h2>
        <p>
            As mentioned before I am pursuing my degree AS degree in Entrepreneurial Studies. I can say it has been a 
            Journey for the past 4 years, as I headed into this college stuff not knowing where to start. I came 
            into El Camino thinking of becoming a nurse. Overtime, things had changed, and I worked on my
            current degree and take my chances of becoming a Realtor. I started taking class that I would 
            never see myself taking and they genuienly helped me understand what I was pursuing and I definetly
            enjoyed learning things I never learned before.
        </p>

        <h2>How College Shapes My Goals?</h2>
        <p>
            College has helped me build more confidence, discipline, and a strong work ethic. 
            As I did not enjoy too much of the courses for becoming a nurse being that it
            challenged me a lot mentally. However, ever since pursuing my new major, it 
            showed me how much my Counselors, Professors, and School overall was willing
            to help me pursue this next big thing for me. I learned a lot about business and
            how to run it and the deep dark sides of it and how to overcome it which is
            something I really enjoyed.

        </p>

        <h2>Life After College</h2>
        <p>
            After earning my degree, I plan to get a Realtor License in California and Nevada with
            as this is where I plan to live within the next few months. I will get the license
            with this Realtor Company called Keller Williams. Once I gain my license, I want to own my own
            brokerage business and plan to help other upcoming entrepreneurs like me reach their goals.
            My education has inspired me to focus not just on success, but on helping others succeed as well.

        <h2>What I Enjoy Most</h2>
        <p>
           One of my favorite things about school is collaborating with classmates on 
            group projects, it helped me overcome my fear of being in groups as I am 
            anti-social/introvert. I also enjoyed learning and taking in any new information that 
            will benefit me in the long run. I’ve also learned to balance school, work, 
            and personal growth is something I’ll carry with me beyond college.
